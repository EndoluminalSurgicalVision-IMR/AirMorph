## Introduction
>> In this work, we introduce AirwayAtlas, a robust, end-to-end deep learning pipeline enabling fully automatic and comprehensive airway anatomical labeling at lobar, segmental, and subsegmental resolutions. To facilitate precise clinical interpretation, we further propose AirwaySign, a compact anatomical signature quantifying critical morphological airway featuresâ€”including stenosis, ectasia, tortuosity, divergence, length, and complexity. Additionally, AirwayAtlas supports efficient automated branching pattern analysis, significantly enhancing bronchoscopic navigation planning and procedural safety.



## Usage

### Binary Airway Modeling
Please refer to ```segmentator/airway_segmentator.py```.

### Airway Anatomical Modeling
Please refer to ```classifier/airway_classifier.py```.


Optionally, you can use the script for a quick start:

```
python airwayatlas_pipeline.py
```

### Airway Signature

The morphological airway signatures can be found in ```features/airway_morph_features.py```.

Optionally, you can use the script for a quick start:

```
python airwaysign_pipeline.py
```
