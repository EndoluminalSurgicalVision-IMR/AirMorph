## Introduction
In this work, we introduce AirwayAtlas, a robust, end-to-end deep learning pipeline enabling fully automatic and comprehensive airway anatomical labeling at lobar, segmental, and subsegmental resolutions. 
To facilitate precise clinical interpretation, we further propose AirwaySign, a compact anatomical signature quantifying critical morphological airway featuresâ€”including stenosis, ectasia, tortuosity, divergence, length, and complexity. 
Additionally, AirwayAtlas supports efficient automated branching pattern analysis, significantly enhancing bronchoscopic navigation planning and procedural safety.
