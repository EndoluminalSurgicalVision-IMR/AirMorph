## Introduction
>> In this work, we introduce AirwayNet, a robust, end-to-end deep learning pipeline enabling fully automatic and comprehensive airway anatomical labeling at lobar, segmental, and subsegmental resolutions. To facilitate precise clinical interpretation, we further propose an anatomical signature, quantifying critical morphological airway featuresâ€”including stenosis, ectasia, tortuosity, divergence, length, and complexity. Additionally, AirwayNet supports efficient automated branching pattern analysis, significantly enhancing bronchoscopic navigation planning and procedural safety.



## Usage

### Binary Airway Modeling
Please refer to ```segmentator/airway_segmentator.py```.

### Airway Anatomical Modeling
Please refer to ```classifier/airway_classifier.py```.


Optionally, you can use the script for a quick start:

```
python airwayatlas_pipeline.py
```

### Airway Signature

The morphological airway signatures can be found in ```features/airway_morph_features.py```.

Optionally, you can use the script for a quick start:

```
python airwaysign_pipeline.py
```
